# Evaluation and execution

## Exercises solutions

1. Consider the following program: (temperature values are expressed in degrees Celsius)
   
    ```kotlin
    import kotlin.random.Random

    fun main() {
        val bodyTemperature = Random.nextDouble(31.0, 42.0)
        print("Your temperature is ${bodyTemperature} --> ")
        if (bodyTemperature >= 37.5) println("You may have a fever")
        else println("You have not a fever")
    }
    ```   
   1. Knowing that the expression `Random.nextDouble(31.0, 42.0)` produces a random number in the interval `[31.0, 42.0[` each time it's evaluated, what is the result of the program's executions?

      __Answer:__    
      Each time the program is executed, it displays a message indicating the body temperature (the randomly generated value) and, if the temperature is `37.5` degrees Celsius or higher, displays the message "You may have a fever". Otherwise it displays the message "You have not a fever".


   2. Change the program so that the value of `bodyTemperature` has, at most, one decimal place. For example, if the value generated by `Random.nextDouble(31.0, 42.0)` is `34.57017711136368`, the value stored in the variable should be `34.5`.

      __Answer:__    
      ```kotlin
      import kotlin.random.Random

      fun main() {
          val bodyTemperature = (Random.nextDouble(31.0, 42.0) * 10).toInt() / 10.0
          print("Your temperature is ${bodyTemperature} : ")
          if (bodyTemperature >= 37.5) println("you have a fever")
          else println("you have not a fever")
      }
      ```

   3. Rewrite the program so that `print`, or its variant `println` are only used once. The new version of the program must have the same behaviour, in particular, the displayed messages should be identical.
      
      __Answer:__    
      ```kotlin
      import kotlin.random.Random

      fun main() {
          val bodyTemperature = (Random.nextDouble(31.0, 42.0) * 10).toInt() / 10.0
          val diagnostic = 
            if (bodyTemperature >= 37.5) "you have a fever" 
            else "you have not a fever"

          println("Your temperature is ${bodyTemperature} : ${diagnostic}")
      }
      ```

   4. Change the program so that it displays the following messages:
      * `Your temperature is ... : you are ok`, if the temperature is between `36.0` and `37.5`
      * `Your temperature is ... : you have a fever`, if the temperature is between `37.5` and `41.0`
      * `Your temperature is ... : you have hypothermia`, if the temperature is between `32.0` and `35.0`
      * `Your temperature is ... : get a doctor, now!`, if the temperature is over `41.0` or below `32.0`
      
      The program can only use `print`, or its variant `println`, once.

      ```kotlin
      import kotlin.random.Random

      fun main() {
          val bodyTemperature = (Random.nextDouble(31.0, 42.0) * 10).toInt() / 10.0
          val diagnostic = when {
            bodyTemperature >= 36.0 && bodyTemperature < 37.5 -> "you are ok"
            bodyTemperature >= 37.5 && bodyTemperature < 41.0 -> "you have a fever"
            bodyTemperature >= 32.0 && bodyTemperature < 35.0 -> "you have hypothermia"
            else -> "get a doctor, now!"
          }
          println("Your temperature is ${bodyTemperature} : ${diagnostic}")
      }
      ```
