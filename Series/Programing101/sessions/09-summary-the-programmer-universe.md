1. Revisiting the elements of the programmerÂ´s universe
   
   1. Data representations, a cornerstone of our mental model
      1. Representations are built through **composition** of primitive values into aggregates (objects) which, in turn, can be further composed into other aggregates
      2. The type system is used to define those representations and to enforce the rules that those representations must abide by
  
   2. Behaviour (what a program does)
      1. Simple expressions (values and variables) and their **composition** through operations into composite expressions which, in turn, can be further composed into other composite expressions
      2. Execution models: Substitution model (data flow) and execution control (program flow) 
      3. Basic elements of code reuse and code organization: functions and effects
   
   3. Leveraging existing code
      1. We do not reinvent the wheel: we undersand it! We could build it, but most of the times we simply use it just because its there. And with it, we build wonderful contraptions. ðŸ§™ðŸ”®

          "The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be." - [Frederick P. Brooks Jr., The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)    

      2. Identifying the targets of our program
         1. Where will it run?
         2. Which are the minimal requirements?

      3. The programming model: 
         1. It's the set of laws that govern the programmer's universe (for a particular technology stack)
         2. It determines the programmer's experience because those rules cannot be ignored. If they are, we find ourselves where ["Here be dragons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)
         3. By leveraging existing code (e.g. frameworks) we usually also choose a programming model.

2. Demo: [The bouncing ball](https://gist.github.com/palbp/55f8477f232b06f8bfdf7d30f4735d2a)
   1. Can we understand it a little better now?
