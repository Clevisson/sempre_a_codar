# Programming 101

Video series aimed at teaching programming to novices. The audio language is Portuguese (PT) but all other materials are in English.
The programming language used in the series is Kotlin.

Initial requirements for following along: 
* a browser
* the will and the time (the latter is a function of the former)

## Outline (work in progress)

* [Introduction (15 mins)](./01-introduction.md)
  * To whom is the series designed for?
  * What do we need to follow along?
  * What will be the outcome?

* The programmer's universe - part 1
  * [Values and objects](02-values-and-objects.md)
  * [Types and operations](03-types-and-operations.md)
  * Identity and equivalence
  * Mutability and immutability

## References
Along my journey I've studied a vast ammount of materials and therefore my "universe" has been built by them; it would be unfeasible to enumerate them all. It would also be useless to anyone trying to begin the Programmer's journey. Instead, I leave you my most recent inspiration sources, created by two great professionals: 
* [Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/), by Dan Abramov
* [The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=6), by Daniel Shiffman

I'll make other references in the series's materials.
