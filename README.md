# _Sempre a codar_ repository

Repository for the artifacts created while streaming for my channel [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/paulo_pereira), where I share subjects related to software development. 

Some of the iniciatives I have planned include teaching programming to novices and streaming while coding some simple retro games, like Snake and Robots. Most of the coding will be done using Kotlin. The programs that are written will run in severall environments: in Android devices, in the browser, and on the JVM.
