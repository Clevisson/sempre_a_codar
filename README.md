# sempre_a_codar

Projects developed while streaming for "sempre a codar" where I plan to stream while coding some simple retro games like Snake and Robots. The coding will be mostly done for Android and using Kotlin.

The stream name is inpired by [Abomin√°vel Homem das Neves - Gato Fedorento](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CkGFUGLaiY)
